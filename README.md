This script prompts the user for two numbers and allows them to perform various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, division, and division with remainder.

### [datasets.py](datasets.py)

This script performs data analysis on a dataset of student performance factors. It includes data visualization and a linear regression model to predict student scores.

### [math.ipynb](math.ipynb)

An empty Jupyter notebook set up for Python 3.

### [practice.py](practice.py)

A simple script that prompts the user to enter two numbers and then divides the first number by the second, handling invalid input gracefully.
